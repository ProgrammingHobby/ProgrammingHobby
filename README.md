Hello,

I am a hobby programmer interested in technology and computers.

I like to program in Lazarus / Free Pascal, and also find C/C++ with wxWidgets very exciting.

I try to write my programs cross-platform for Linux and Windows. The main development takes place under Linux.

Professionally, I work as a CNC miller and CAD/CAM programmer.
